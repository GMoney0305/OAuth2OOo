# OAuth2OOo v.0.0.1

## OAuth2.0 implementation for LibreOffice.

![OAuth2OOo screenshot](OAuth2OOo.png)


The OAuth2.0 protocol allows the connection to servers, after acceptance of the connection authorization, by exchange of tokens.

The revocation takes place in the management of: [Application associated with your Google account](https://myaccount.google.com/security?utm_source=OGB#connectedapps)

No more password is stored in LibreOffice.

## Has been tested with:
	
* LibreOffice 5.3.3.2 - Lubuntu 16.10 -  LxQt 0.11.0.3

* LibreOffice 5.3.1.2 x86 - Windows 7 SP1

I encourage you in case of problem to create an [issue](https://github.com/prrvchr/OAuth2OOo/issues/new)
I will try to solve it :-)
