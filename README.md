The OAuth2.0 protocol allows the connection to resource servers, after acceptance of the connection authorization, by exchange of tokens.

The revocation takes place in the management of the applications associated with your account.

No more password is stored in LibreOffice.

## Has been tested with:
	
* LibreOffice 6.0.2.1 x86_64 - Ubuntu 17.10 - LxQt 0.11.1

* OpenOffice 4.1.5 x86_64 - Ubuntu 17.10 - LxQt 0.11.1

I encourage you in case of problem to create an [issue](https://github.com/prrvchr/OAuth2OOo/issues/new)
I will try to solve it :-)
